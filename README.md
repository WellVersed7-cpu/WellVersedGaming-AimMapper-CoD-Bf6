# Well-Versed Gaming AimMapper — CoD → Battlefield 6 (v34b)

### 🎮 Overview
Translate your **Call of Duty / Warzone** sensitivity and aim curve directly into **Battlefield 6**.  
Visualize both curves (including the new BF6 Dynamic curve), test controller deadzones, and export full presets.

### ⚡ How to Use
1. Download this repo or open the live web app (see link below).  
2. Enter your CoD settings: Horizontal 1.50 / Vertical 1.50, Dynamic Curve 0.85–1.00.  
3. Click **TRANSLATE ⚡ TO BF6** — a numbered block appears.  
4. Copy the block and enter values in BF6 Settings → Controller → Advanced.  
5. Run the **Deadzones & Triggers** tab once to measure stick drift and idle values.

### 🧠 Quick Tips
- **UIA ON** keeps zooms consistent → set all per-zoom sliders to 100.  
- **Coefficient 178 (Affected)** or 163 (Independent).  
- **Triggers:** MIN 0 / MAX 5 for fast response.  
- **Head-Bob Reduction ON**, motion blur 0, vibration off.  
- If ADS feels too twitchy → lower Zoom Aim a bit (e.g. 95 → 92).  
- If Aim Assist “bubble” drags → Slowdown −5 (90 → 85).

### 🕹️ Why It Matters
Switching from CoD to BF6 feels wrong because the aim families are built differently.  
AimMapper translates those curves precisely so you can lock in again in seconds.
